# Intervals

Intervals are particularly useful in various problem-solving scenarios, including scheduling, resource allocation, and geometric computations.

When to Use:
- Range Queries: When you need to represent or manipulate ranges of values, such as time intervals, numerical ranges, or geometric regions.
- Intersection and Union Operations: Problems requiring merging overlapping intervals or determining common intervals between sets of intervals.
- Event Scheduling: Managing and scheduling events or tasks based on their start and end times.
- Resource Allocation: Allocating resources over time, such as meeting rooms, CPU time, or bandwidth.

Why to Use:
- Representation: Provides a clear and structured way to represent and manage ranges of values.
- Efficiency: Allows efficient operations like merging overlapping intervals or finding intersections, often in logarithmic or linear time complexity.
- Problem Solving: Many algorithmic problems, especially in scheduling and optimization, can be efficiently tackled using interval-based approaches.

How to Use:
- Interval Representation: Each interval typically consists of a start and end value, denoting the inclusive or exclusive range.
- Sorting: Often, intervals are sorted by their start values to facilitate efficient merging or intersection operations.

A clean code tip here is to define start and end positions as constants:
```go
const (
  START = 0
  END = 1
)
```
```javascript
const START = 0, END = 1;
```
