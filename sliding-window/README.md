# Sliding Window

This technique is used to solve problems that involve subarrays, and in some cases the subsequences.

When to Use:
- When dealing with subarrays or substrings.
- Problems involving finding a subarray/subsequence with a specific property.

How to Use:
- Use two pointers to create a window representing the current subarray or substring.
- Slide the window over the array or string, adjusting the pointers and updating the condition as necessary.

Why to Use:
- Efficient for solving problems in linear time complexity, O(n), by avoiding nested loops.
