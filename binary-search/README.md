# Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items in `O(logn)` time complexity.

When to Use:
- When dealing with sorted arrays.
- Finding an element or condition within a range.

How to Use:
- Use two pointers or indices to represent the current search range.
- Calculate the middle point and adjust the search range based on the target.

Why to Use:
- Efficient for searching in `O(log n)` time complexity.
