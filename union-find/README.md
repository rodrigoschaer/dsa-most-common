# Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

Commonly used for finding cycles in an undirected graph and in Kruskal's algorithm for MST.

When to Use:
- When dealing with disjoint sets.
- Problems involving connectivity and cycle detection in graphs.

How to Use:
- Use an array to represent the parent of each element.
- Implement find and union operations with path compression and union by rank.

Why to Use:
- Efficient for solving dynamic connectivity problems, usually in near-constant time complexity.
