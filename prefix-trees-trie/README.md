# Prefix Trees (Tries)

Tries, also known as prefix trees, are tree-like data structures that are primarily used for storing and searching strings in a way that allows efficient prefix queries.

When to Use:
- Prefix Matching: When you need to efficiently find all strings with a given prefix.
- Dictionary-like Data Structure: When storing a large set of strings and performing operations like insertions, deletions, and lookups efficiently.
- Autocomplete and Spell Checker: Applications where predicting or suggesting words based on partial input is required.

Why to Use:
- Efficiency: Tries provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations for strings, typically in O(m) time complexity, where m is the length of the string.
- Prefix Queries: Allows quick retrieval of all strings starting with a given prefix without scanning through all entries.
- Space Efficiency: Tries can be more space-efficient compared to other data structures for certain types of string-related problems.

How to Use:
- Trie Node Structure: Define a node structure where each node represents a character and may have links to child nodes.
- Insertion Operation: Insert strings into the Trie by creating nodes as necessary.
- Search Operation: Check if a string exists in the Trie.
- Prefix Search: Retrieve all strings with a given prefix by traversing the Trie.
- Deletion Operation: Remove strings from the Trie while maintaining its structure.
