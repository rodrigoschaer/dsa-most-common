# Two Pointers

The two-pointer technique is often used for problems involving arrays or linked lists.

The idea is to minimize the accesses in an array.

When to Use:
- When you need to search pairs in a sorted array.
- When you're dealing with a problem that involves finding a combination of elements that satisfy a condition (e.g., sum, difference).

How to Use:
- Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.
- Move the pointers towards each other based on the condition.

Why to Use:
- Efficient for solving problems with linear time complexity, O(n), by reducing the nested loops.
