# Breadth First Search

BFS is typically used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

They are commonly used when we want to traverse layer by layer (layer, level, step, whatever):
- When to Use:
Traversing tree or graph structures.
When the shortest path or level-by-level traversal is needed.

- How to Use:
Use a queue to explore all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

- Why to Use:
Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

There are 3 main variations that could be used in BFS:
- Simple/Common BFS
- BFS processing whole layer first
- BFS counting levels
